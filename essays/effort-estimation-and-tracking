##Timing the Tick of the Clock

A man named William Penn once said, “Time is what we want most, but what we use worst.” (Goodreads, n.d.) <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/237292.William_Penn">[1]</a>. This could not be more true on a project, when you are rushing to complete something by a short deadline, but get distracted along the way, adding in little things here and there on the side, eventually taking much longer to complete something that could have been done in much less time. This is fine when it comes to vibe coding projects, where you can do whatever you want when you feel like it and you have no quota or deliverable to meet, but absolutely not the case when you are working for a client. This is where effort estimation comes in handy. By trying to figure out what you need to accomplish and how long it will take, you can gauge whether or not you can complete the project by a certain time, and also set a goal for yourself which can make it easier to stay focused on completing tasks.

##Evaluating and Estimating my Efforts

This past month throughout November and December, I’ve been working with a team to complete a website that allows students to study together. In order to gauge how long it would take me to complete my sections of the website and set time goals for myself, I made estimates of each of my tasks. This estimate took into account the size of my task, as well as my coding speed and my ability to research in the event that I needed to implement something that I was not familiar with. If the task was similar to something else that I’ve created, then I would also take that into consideration for my estimation. However, these similarities would basically be annulled if the task was complicated enough to where I couldn’t build off of previous work.

##Errors in Estimation

Despite taking so many factors into consideration when creating my estimation, I usually came across problems while coding which brought me over my original target time. This usually had to deal with deployment, in addition to ESLint errors and other errors related to the database (which had a lot of iterations). Merging items also contributed to going over the estimation, since working with others’ code tended to create conflict due to different coding styles. Despite this, creating estimations did help tremendously, as I could generally determine how many days I needed to spend on a particular task, and plan ahead when necessary. Even if I went over on time for a particular task, I could just adjust my estimations for my other tasks and still complete things on time. Adjusting my estimations also sometimes led me to overestimate my time, which meant that I could save time and allocate more time into other tasks.

##Tracking Effort

In order to determine how long I was taking for each task, I would set a timer when I started to code, which would only stop if I was completed with the project or pause when I had to leave intermittently to do something else. This meant that for most of my tasks, I quite accurately could figure out my completion times, though sometimes for the non-coding time spent on the project I was not too accurate since I didn’t always time those or they were incorporated into the coding time. With that being said, tracking my effort to some degree of accuracy did prove to be useful because it informed me of how long I was actually taking to complete tasks and allowed me to make more accurate estimations for future assignments.

##Examining Future Attempts at Estimation and Tracking

Since this project was the first that I spent a concerted effort on estimating and tracking my efforts, I believe that there is much more I could have done to be more accurate and efficient in my endeavors. The first thing I would change would be the tools that I used to track my efforts. Although the timer was quite accurate, it didn’t really work when I was both doing coding and non-coding actions during a task, since the timer was only really timing my coding actions. To fix this, I would have a separate timer that exclusively tracked my coding and my non-coding actions, maybe something built into VSCode to see when I was on the application, and then a timer for when I am researching on the internet. For my estimation, I believe my accuracy can be increased by adding in time to take care of any errors from myself or from conflicts with others’ code, as that wasn’t something that I really factored in when creating my estimations for this particular project. 

With the conclusion of this project, I’ve learned a lot about how to track time, how to form tasks that weren’t too overwhelming, and how to estimate completion of tasks. Since it is only a matter of time before I start working on projects for clients, this is a skill that I will need to hone and improve upon in the future. Wasted time is wasted effort, and time waits for no one, so it is best to make the most of the time you have, which you can start by learning how to plan out how to effectively utilize your time through estimation and tracking of effort.

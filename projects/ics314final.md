## Overview

The main goal of creating the Study Buddy application is to create a space where University of Hawaii students can connect with each other and form study commmunities, to help students build a stronger knowledgebase and improve the acquisition of knowledge on UH campuses through shared cooperation. In particular, this app was specifically built for ICS users to connect and form study sessions to aid in their progress throughout the semester.

This project was created during the Fall 2024 semester at UH Manoa for the semesterly game jam that the Game Development Club hosts. 
The goal of this project was to create an adventure game called Tezcat, that had you looting treasure within an ancient Aztec temple. 
The character that you played as was the Plunderer, whose goal is to get through the entire dungeon without getting caught or hit by enemies, all the way to the bottom of the dungeon, where the game would be completed.

To aid in the completion of this game, I was assigned to the procedural generation team, which was responsible for the creation and formation of the map (which is randomized with each new game), the spawning of enemies, and the change in difficulty as the game progressed. 
Working on this project allowed me to learn more about utilizing Unity, GitHub, and C# (which was an entirely new language to me before the game jam). 
I also improved my coordination and communication skills, as we had weekly meetings where we were providing constant updates on our project, and informing the entire club of any changes that we needed to make along the way, in addition to communicating with fellow team members to make sure that we were on the right track, and that our code would function properly when merged together to create the final product.

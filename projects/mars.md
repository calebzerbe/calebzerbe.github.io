summary: "My team and I developed a web site for the Hawaii Marine Animal Response organization that won first place in the 2021 Hawaii Annual Coding Challenge."
---

This project was created during the 2021 Hawaii Annual Coding Challenge (HACC) to aid the Hawaii Marine Animal Response organization, the largest Hawaii non-profit marine species conservation and response organization. 
We particularly aimed to solve the issue of HMAR not having an online form to submit any sightings of marine life in distress. 
At the time of the 2021 challenge, you could only call HMAR to report a sighting, which is quite slow and burdensome for operators on the HMAR side. 
Our website created several web pages, one of which included a web form that allowed users to submit sightings online, with the capability to share the userâ€™s location with HMAR, send images, and send additional information to help the animal. 
Once the sighting was submitted, it was added to a spreadsheet containing all reports, allowing HMAR volunteers to look through submissions for more information to assist the animal in distress.

I was assigned on the front end team, designing the web pages, which was for the most part based upon the original HMAR website, in case our project were to be utilized by HMAR. 
I also worked on creating the user experience, for both the users creating reports and HMAR volunteers. 
Once the design process was done, myself and 2-3 others coded the HTML and CSS required to create the homepage, user form, navigation, and the pages for HMAR volunteers, all of which included creating support for mobile devices. 
This project in particular taught me not only how to work in a team, but also how to design a website that would be user friendly and easy to understand. 
This was also my first real experience in how to get work done on a tight deadline (you have less than a month to decide what project you want to do and how you want to do it during the HACC), how to divide up tasks to increase work efficiency, and how to communicate with others effectively.
